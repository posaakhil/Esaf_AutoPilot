Automated end-to-end solution for HCA Healthcare's ESAF access request processing.

## 🚀 Features
- UI Automation using `pyautogui`
- Smart assignment logic
- Executive dashboard with Plotly
- One-click orchestration via `autopilot.py`

## ⚙️ Setup Guide

Follow the steps below to get started with **ESAF AutoPilot** on your Windows machine:

### 🧩 Step 1 — Download & Prepare
- Download the latest version of **Esaf AutoPilot** (`autopilot.exe`).
- Create a new folder (for example, `C:\ESAF_AutoPilot`) and place the downloaded file inside it.  
  > 💡 Keeping it in a dedicated folder helps manage configuration and log files neatly.

---

### ⚙️ Step 2 — Initial Configuration
- Launch the application and choose **Option 1** from the main menu.  
- Configure **mouse coordinates**, **timing**, and other required settings as prompted.  
  > 🖱️ These configurations are saved locally, so you don’t need to set them every time.

### 🚀 Step 3 — Run the Process
You can now run the automation in one of two ways:
1. **Full End-to-End Process** – Executes the complete ESAF automation automatically.  
2. **Step-by-Step Mode** – Allows manual control of each automation phase.  

> ⚠️ **Tip:** Ensure all required windows (like the ESAF portal) are open and visible before starting.
